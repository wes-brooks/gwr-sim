SGL                     Fit a GLM with a combination of lasso and group
                        lasso regularization
SGL-package             Fit a GLM (or cox model) with a combination of
                        lasso and group lasso regularization
cvSGL                   Fit and cross-validate a GLM with a combination
                        of lasso and group lasso regularization
plot.cv.SGL             plots the cross-validated error curve produced
                        by cv.SGL
predictSGL              Outputs predicted responses from an SGL model
                        for new observations
