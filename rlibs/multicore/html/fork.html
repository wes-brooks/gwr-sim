<h2>
Fork a copy of the current R process
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>fork</code> creates a new child process as a copy of the current R process
</p>
<p><code>exit</code> closes the current child process, informing the master process as necessary
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
fork()
exit(exit.code = 0L, send = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exit.code</code></td>
<td>
<p>process exit code. Currently it is not used by
multicore, but other applciations might. By convention 0 signifies
clean exit, 1 an error.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>send</code></td>
<td>
<p>if not <code>NULL</code> send this data before exiting
(equivalent to using <code><a href="sendMaster.html">sendMaster</a></code>)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>fork</code> function provides an interface to the <code>fork</code>
system call. In addition it sets up a pipe between the master and
child process that can be used to send data from the child process
to the master (see <code><a href="sendMaster.html">sendMaster</a></code>) and child's stdin is
re-mapped to another pipe held by the master process (see
<code>link{sendChildStdin}</code>).
</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the <code>fork</code> system call, do not
use this function since it leads to very complex inter-process
interactions among the R processes involved.
</p>
<p>In a nutshell <code>fork</code> spawns a copy (child) of the current
process, that can work in parallel to the master (parent)
process. At the point of forking both processes share exactly the
same state including the workspace, global options, loaded packages
etc. Forking is relatively cheap in modern operating systems and no
real copy of the used memory is created, instead both processes
share the same memory and only modified parts are copied. This makes
<code>fork</code> an ideal tool for parallel processing since there is no
need to setup the parallel working environment, data and code is
shared automatically from the start.
</p>
<p>It is <EM>strongly discouraged</EM> to use <code>fork</code> in GUI or
embedded environments, because it leads to several processes sharing
the same GUI which will likely cause chaos (and possibly
crashes). Child processes should never use on-screen graphics
devices.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>fork</code> returns an object of the class <code>childProcess</code> (to
the master) and <code>masterProcess</code> (to the child).
</p>
<p><code>exit</code> never returns
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>This is a very low-level API for expert use only. If you are
interested in user-level parallel execution use
<code><a href="mclapply.html">mclapply</a></code>, <code><a href="parallel.html">parallel</a></code> and friends instead.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Windows opearting system lacks the <code>fork</code> system call so it
cannot be used with multicore.
